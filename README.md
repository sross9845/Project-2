#Washington Street Fighter Web App (Possibly extended to other fighting games)

##Description
Being an avid fighting game fan I wanted a central place where people can list events and communicate for local fighting game play. Gone are the days where if you wanted to play any fighting game you would have to go to an arcade to play in person or settle for what was mostly worse versions of the game with the console ports. Being a grassroots community like this community is has it's ups and downs. In California or New York the communities are huge and people move to be in that competitive and fun of an atmosphere. Seattle is growing in this regard. We have bi-weekly meetups on tuesdays and thursdays in Seattle and we have a monthly event that is even bigger. We host large tournaments like Red Bull Conquest and Northwest Majors. How do I know all this you ask? Well that is the problem I am trying to solve. I learned all about this from multiple resources. I stumbled upon the Discord channel for it, found tournaments on smash.gg, and learned about the game through reddit. Sure there are sites that do what parts of my site are going to do but better. However I am looking to make a site that incorporates all of this into one truly making it the perfect spring board and community the Seattle Fighting Game Community (FGC) needs.

##MVP
- [ ] Show tournaments happening around the world (prototyped and can be improved by Graph QL).
- [ ] Be able to create events and search by city (search by city is a possible stretch).
- [ ] Show event page and info. Where to register and a Description.
- [ ] Comment Section on pages for discussion.
- [ ] Save events to your profile showing event times and reminders.
- [ ] Links to relative articles and discussion platforms

##Stretch Goals
- [ ] Chat area for discussion
- [ ] Twitch channel area that could possibly tie into the chat area
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Other games (Tekken, UNIST, Killer Instinct, MvC, Etc.)

##Day 1 - 3 
Most of these days were planning. Figuring out my API was pretty fun but challenging. The documentation for the REST API I ended up using was not too great. They moved on to a GraphQL API. I ended up finding a community discord page for the old and new API and the moderators on that have been alot of help! I finished planning out alot of my models and my paths. Learned about alot of cool features already included in the API like the latitude and longitude already included in the API. I am hoping that this can help greatly with the stretch goal of mapbox.
